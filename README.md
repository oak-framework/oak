# OAK Framework
OAK frame work is a simple and basic framework built on top of other open-sourced projects and it is quite suitable for extension.

Some of the most excellent features include RedBeanPHP and Nette's Latte. You will never have to deal with what's going on in the database while you're developing your application.

OAK Framework is highly impressed by how Laravel is built so if you are used to Laravel. You will feel like home when your developing with OAK.

We also have **Zeus** instead of Laravel's Artisan with its own unique commands.
